# cajeta-http plan (`http`)

cajeta-http is the HTTP/WebSocket/SSE library over the stdlib `cajeta.io.net`
transport. Spec: [`docs/http-spec.md`](../docs/http-spec.md). The HTTP/1.1 +
WebSocket core already exists in the stdlib (`cajeta/docs/Net.md`,
`runtime/src/cajeta/io/net/http/` + `.../ws/`) and is being **extracted** into
this library; the HTTP/2, middleware, and SSE surface is new design layered on top.

Tasks carry outline ids (`http:<id>`); each unit is worked test-first
(tests → code → acceptance). `- [x]` = done, `- [~]` = blocked (blocker noted).

## 0 — Extraction (from stdlib into this library)

- [x] **0.1 Test harness bootstrap.** A `test/src` tree compiled against the
  built `.cja` (raw compiler CLI: `--emit=exe --classpath=${art.path}`,
  entry `dev.cajeta.http.test.TestMain::main`), wired into the manifest's
  `test` task (build → exec compile → test). The toolchain's
  `src/test/cajeta` + `cajeta.testkit` pipeline is designed but not yet
  implemented (no test-source-root support, testkit unpublished), and the
  scaffolded `test` task nested params the runner never reads — this unit
  replaces both with what works today.
  - TDD: smoke test (`Http.version()`) fails before wiring, passes after.
  - Acceptance: `cajeta test` exits 0 and runs the test binary.
- [x] **0.2 Extract the HTTP/1.1 wire codec** — `HttpRequest`, `HttpResponse`,
  `HttpParser(+Limits)`, `HttpSerializer`, `BodyFraming`, `BodyReader`,
  `ChunkedEncoder`, `KeepAlive`, and the HTTP exception family — from
  `cajeta.io.net.http` into `dev.cajeta.http` (package + import retarget only;
  no redesign). *(Was blocked on a cajeta compiler bug — any user class whose
  simple name collided with an embedded-stdlib class failed the build; fixed
  in the cajeta repo via scoped bare-name resolution in `CajetaType`.)*
  - TDD first: parser golden vectors (status line, headers, content-length +
    chunked bodies, malformed rejects), serializer round-trip, chunked
    encode/decode, keep-alive decisions.
  - Acceptance: library `.cja` builds; codec suite passes.
- [x] **0.3 Extract the server** — `HttpServer(+Builder)`, `Router`, `Route`,
  `PathParams`, `ServerLimits`, `Exchange`, `ExpectContinue`,
  `RequestBodyStream`, `ResponseBodyWriter` → `dev.cajeta.http`.
  - TDD first: router match/dispatch (param binding, 404, 405+Allow),
    loopback server exercised with raw `TcpStream` requests.
  - Acceptance: server suite passes (fiber-per-connection model; the
    shared-pool accept model is exercised by the stdlib's own harness and
    rides the same `Server` core).
- [ ] **0.4 Extract the client** — `HttpClient` → `dev.cajeta.http`.
  - TDD first: loopback client↔server exchange (GET + POST body, status,
    headers).
  - Acceptance: client suite passes against the 0.3 server.
- [ ] **0.5 Extract WebSocket** — the RFC 6455 stack (`WebSocket`, frame
  codec, handshakes, control frames, assembler, close codes, exceptions)
  from `cajeta.io.net.ws` into `dev.cajeta.http.ws`.
  - TDD first: frame encode/decode round-trips (masking, 7/16/64-bit
    lengths), `Sec-WebSocket-Accept` derivation, fragmentation reassembly,
    loopback echo over an upgraded connection.
  - Acceptance: WS suite passes.
- [ ] **0.6 samples/tour** — a self-checking tour of the library surface,
  modeled on `cajeta/samples/tour`: HttpServer + Router over loopback, an
  HttpClient exchange against it, and a WebSocket echo; README + run script;
  exits non-zero on any failed check.
  - Acceptance: `samples/tour/run.sh` prints the walkthrough and exits 0.
- [ ] **0.7 Retire the stdlib copies** — remove `cajeta.io.net.http` /
  `cajeta.io.net.ws` from the cajeta repo stdlib and migrate its tests/docs.
  **Cajeta-repo-side work** — tracked there (see
  `cajeta/agents/cajeta/external/cajeta-http-completion.md`); not workable
  from this repo.

## 1 — HTTP/1.1 core (beyond extracted parity)

- [ ] **1.1** Spec package layout: split flat `dev.cajeta.http` into
  `.body` / `.client` / `.server` / `.routing` / `.h1` per the spec.
- [ ] **1.2** Core-type completion: `Method`/`Status`/`Headers`/`MediaType`
  helpers per spec (`isSafe`, registry, typed accessors).
- [ ] **1.3** `Body` abstraction: in-memory + streaming, form, multipart
  (+ `MultipartParser`).
- [ ] **1.4** Client: connection pool + keep-alive, redirects, retry,
  timeouts, streaming bodies, `getJson<T>`, transparent gzip/deflate.
- [ ] **1.5** Server hardening: request timeout, max body size, slowloris
  header deadline, backlog config.

## 2 — Middleware

- [ ] **2.1** `Middleware` composition (registration order).
- [ ] **2.2** Bundled set: RequestId, Logging, Recover, Timeout, CORS,
  Compression/Decompression, RateLimit, BasicAuth, BearerAuth, StaticFile,
  ETag, ProxyHeaders.

## 3 — HTTP/2

- [ ] **3.1** HPACK; **3.2** frame framing (zero-copy `view`); **3.3** stream
  multiplexing + flow control; **3.4** ALPN negotiation + h2c upgrade;
  **3.5** opt-in server push. Behind the same client/server surface.

## 4 — WebSocket completeness + SSE

- [ ] **4.1** `permessage-deflate` (RFC 7692); **4.2** one-line
  `connect`/upgrade convenience; **4.3** Autobahn conformance.
- [ ] **4.4** SSE server + client (`text/event-stream`).

## 5 — HTTP/3 (deferred)

- [ ] **5.1** HTTP/3 over QUIC over UDP — gated on a QUIC state machine over
  `cajeta.io.net` UDP sockets. Designed-for in the transport abstraction;
  not in the near term.

Phases 1–5 are headline-level; break a unit into TDD granularity (design
skill) before implementing it.

## Out of scope (other layers own these)

- Transport (sockets, reactor, TLS, URI) — stdlib `cajeta.io.net`.
- REST endpoints, annotation routing, auto-serde-to-object — **primavera**.
- gRPC — a separate library over HTTP/2.
